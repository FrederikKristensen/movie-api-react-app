This is a project I have been wanting to do for a while. Here I want to combine a few of the skills I have developed recently. Will be React, Typescript, Tailwind, API requests, Eslint and prettier. Also tried out enviorment file so I can store my api key and api base url, in that file while still calling the variables when needed.

The project will be a movie react app, that takes data thro a API called TMDB. This way I had to challenge myself to learn to read API documentation, understand it try it out with postman.
